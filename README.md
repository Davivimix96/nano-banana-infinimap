## üìñ How It Works

Nano Banana Infinimap uses advanced AI techniques to create seamless maps. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Tile-Based Generation**: The application splits maps into tiles, processing each one individually to maintain quality and detail. A 3x3 grid of tiles fits perfectly within the AI limits, ensuring a consistent look.

- **Blending for Quality**: When generating new tiles, the software blends them with existing ones, smoothing transitions and providing a natural look.

- **Adjustable Parameters**: You can tweak various settings for size and detail level. Explore the options to find what works best for your needs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

For the best experience, please ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB of RAM recommended for smoother performance.
- **Storage**: Minimum of 400 MB of free space to accommodate the application and generated data.

## üîß Troubleshooting
